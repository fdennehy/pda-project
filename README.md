**Finbar Dennehy**

I'm currently undertaking the [HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) on a part time basis at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/)

I have over ten years' experience in capital markets consultancy and have spent the past few years working on software delivery and customer success. I am undertaking this program to better understand our clients, who are predominantly data scientists and data engineers.
