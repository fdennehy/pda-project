## About This Project

This repository contains one Jupyter Notebook (penguins.ipynb), which explores the Palmer Penguins dataset using analytical methods learned as part of the Principles of Data Analytics module of the [HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics), ATU Galway. In addition to the Jupyter Notebook, the repository contains this README.md file and a .gitignore file. A brief description of each file is provided under the 'Files Description' section.

As stated on the [Official Site](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), "_The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to iris._" The dataset contains data for three penguin species observed in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica, collected and made available by [Dr. Kirsten Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antartica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). For this project, we will be using the simplified version of the raw data.

## Use of this Project

This project may be useful to prospective students of the HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course at ATU Galway, giving an indication of the content of the Principles of Data Analytics moduule and showcasing what can be achieved within a few weeks on the course. It may also be useful to other Python learners beginning their Data Analytics journey.
